# odin-rock-paper-scissors
An Odin Project JS Build.<br />The first function I wrote to randomize Rock, Paper, and Scissors. <br />The second function is for player choice and message. I decided to use a nested switch statement for the win/lose combinations. <br />The final function is to play five rounds with the computer keeping score, and declaring the player as winning/losing.<br />
This was a fun first JavaScript build! The biggest challenges I had were with returning the win/lose statements, and getting the computer to keep score.<br /> Update: the new version includes UI <br />Icons made from https://www.onlinewebfonts.com/icon svg icons is licensed by CC BY 4.0
